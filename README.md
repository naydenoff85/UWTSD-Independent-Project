This is a repository that will keep my code and track the changes on it. 
This code has learning purposes and will be part of my task in creating an Independent Project Report on the topic "Low Cost IoT and Cloud-based Solution for Managing Quality for Small-Scale Brewers".
The Project is my final assignment as an undergraduate at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.
